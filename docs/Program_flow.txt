9 Oct 15  I'm re-thinking the code and program flow, asking for critique.
  Some of the names and classes exist, but will get heavily refactored.


Class Character
  Holds attributes of a character, and minimal methods.
  For example, the name method returns a concatantaion
    of first_name and last_name

Class Chargen
  ?? Should this be a module, since it is never instantiated?

  Subclass of Character, it provides many of the tools 
    for generating Character.attributes.
  This class is usually a super class of a particular career. 

Class Marine
  A subclass of Chargen, it will provide tables for the 
    Chargen methods to act on. 
  There are several careers like "Marine", they all subclass Chargen.


Class Present
  Takes an object of class Character and provides methods to 
    display the object.
